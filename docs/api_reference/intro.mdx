## Welcome

MemMachine provides flexible ways to interact with its powerful memory layer. We've organized our APIs into two main groups to fit your development needs: the **Python SDK** for direct integration and the **API Playground**, which contains our web-standard APIs. This ensures you can seamlessly integrate MemMachine into your projects, no matter your preferred language or architecture.

## Python SDK (Software Development Kit)

The Python SDK is your go-to for directly integrating MemMachine’s capabilities into your Python applications. It's a collection of pre-built modules and functions designed to make interacting with MemMachine feel natural within your Python code.

- **Best For:** Python developers building AI agents, data pipelines, or applications where Python is the primary language.
- **Benefit:** Offers the most direct and idiomatic way to leverage MemMachine’s features within a Python environment, providing a rich set of tools and easy access to all functionalities.

## The API Playground

The API Playground serves as a central hub for our web-based APIs, encompassing both REST and MCP APIs. If you're working outside of a Python environment, this is where you'll find the tools to connect your application to MemMachine.

### REST API (Representational State Transfer API) 

 The REST API provides a web-standard way to interact with MemMachine using simple HTTP requests. It’s a universal interface that can be accessed from virtually any programming language or platform capable of making web requests. 

 - **Best For:** Developers integrating MemMachine into web applications, mobile apps, or backend services using any programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Java, Go, C#). It’s also great for quick testing and scripting. 
 - **Benefit:** Offers unparalleled flexibility and interoperability. If your application can make an HTTP request, it can talk to MemMachine, making it incredibly easy to integrate across a wide range of systems.
