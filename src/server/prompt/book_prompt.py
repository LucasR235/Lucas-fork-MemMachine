- Only return "no new information in user input" for pure queries with NO book or user data
- Otherwise: extract book and or user information following the rules below

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN BOOK DATA AND USER DATA:**
- **Book Data** (tag = book title): Specific information about a particular book (title, author, rating, status, genre, dates, book-specific reviews, quotes, notes)
- **User Data** (tag = "user"): General reading preferences, habits, dislikes, likes that apply to multiple books or reading in general
- **Examples of User Data**: "I hate horror", "I love sci-fi", "I prefer short books", "I don't like romance novels", "I read mostly non-fiction"

- Mixed input with both book and user data â†’ extract both with appropriate tags

Timeline entries:
- For additional_info: Include date at start: "[EDTF_date] [TYPE: content]" where TYPE is review, quote, or note
- For user preferences: Include date at start: "[EDTF_date] content"

Extraction rules:

- **CRITICAL**: Extract information ONLY from the user's new message, NOT from existing profile data provided as context
'''

FIELD_EXTRACTION_SPECIFIC_FIELDS = ''' 
Field guidance:
**Basic fields:**
- book_title: Book title (single-valued)
- author: Author name (single-valued) - support multiple authors
- rating: 1-5 rating (single-valued) - extract when mentioned
- status: reading status (single-valued) - extract when mentioned
- genre: Book genres as single string in order of relevance (single-valued) - derive from content if not explicit
- start_date / finish_date: Reading dates (single-valued)

**Timeline field (additional_info):**
- additional_info: Unified field for all additional book information with intelligent subcategorization:
  * **Review**: Personal opinions, ratings, critiques, "I loved/hated this book", "amazing character development"
  * **Quote**: Direct quotes from the book, memorable passages, "The author wrote...", "My favorite line was..."
  * **Note**: Reading observations, plot points, "reminds me of...", "similar to...", "the ending was..."
- Format: "[EDTF_date] [TYPE: content]" where TYPE is one of: review, quote, note
- Supports multiple entries with dates
- Include date as "[EDTF_date] [TYPE: content]" and "date": "EDTF_format"
- AI should intelligently categorize content within this field based on context and language patterns

**User Preference Fields** (timeline fields with tag="user"):
- **genre_preference**: Genre likes/dislikes ("I love sci-fi", "I hate horror", "Fantasy is my favorite")
- **reading_style**: Reading pace, length, complexity ("I prefer fast-paced books", "I like short books under 300 pages")
- **content_preference**: Themes, settings, characters, tone ("I love time travel stories", "I prefer strong female protagonists")
- **author_preference**: Author likes/dislikes, writing style ("I love Neil Gaiman", "I prefer lyrical prose")
- **reading_habits**: Reading frequency, timing, context ("I read 2-3 books per month", "I read before bed")
- **recommendation_preference**: How they discover books, risk tolerance ("I trust Goodreads ratings", "I like trying new genres")
- Format: "[EDTF_date] content" with "date": "EDTF_format" and tag="user"
- These are separate timeline fields, not subcategories of additional_info

**OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You MUST return valid JSON with "consolidate_memories" and "keep_memories" keys. No exceptions.**

Your job is to perform memory consolidation for a book profile system.
Despite the name, consolidation is not solely about reducing the amount of memories, but rather, minimizing interference between book data points while maintaining reading history integrity.
By consolidating memories, we remove unnecessary couplings of book data from context, spurious correlations inherited from the circumstances of their acquisition.

You will receive a new book memory, as well as a select number of older book memories which are semantically similar to it.
Produce a new list of memories to keep.

A book memory is a json object with 4 fields:
- tag: book title (broad category of memory) or "user" for user preferences
- feature: book field name (book_title, author, rating, status, genre, start_date, finish_date, additional_info, genre_preference, reading_style, content_preference, author_preference, reading_habits, recommendation_preference)
- value: detailed contents of the book field
- metadata: {{}}

You will output consolidated memories, which are json objects with 4 fields:
- tag: string (book title or "user" for user preferences)
- feature: string (book field name)
- value: string (book field content)
- metadata: {{}}

You will also output a list of old memories to keep (memories are deleted by default)

Book-Specific Guidelines:
Book memories should not contain unrelated reading activities. Memories which do are artifacts of couplings that exist in original context. Separate them. This minimizes interference.
Book memories containing only redundant information should be deleted entirely, especially if they seem unprocessed or the information in them has been processed into timeline entries.

**Single-valued fields** (book_title, author, rating, status, genre, start_date, finish_date): If memories are sufficiently similar, but differ in key details, keep only the most recent or complete value. Delete older, less complete versions.
    - To aid in this, you may want to shuffle around the components of each memory, moving the most current information to the value field.
    - Keep only the key details (highest-entropy) in the feature name. The nuances go in the value field.
    - This step allows you to speculatively build towards more permanent book structures.

**Timeline fields** (additional_info, genre_preference, reading_style, content_preference, author_preference, reading_habits, recommendation_preference): If enough memories share similar timeline features (due to prior synchronization, i.e. not done by you), merge them chronologically and create consolidated timeline entries.
    - In these memories, the feature contains the book field type, and the value contains chronologically ordered timeline entries.
    - You can also directly transfer information to existing timeline lists as long as the new item has the same type as the timeline's items.
    - Don't merge timelines too early. Have at least three chronologically related entries in a non-gerrymandered category first. You need to find the natural groupings. Don't force it.
    - User preference fields (tag="user") should only be consolidated with other user preference fields of the same type.

**Book-specific consolidation**:
All memories must have valid tags (book title or "user"). Memories with different tags should never be consolidated together.
- Book memories (tag = book title) should only be consolidated with other memories for the same book
- User preference memories (tag = "user") should only be consolidated with other user preference memories

**EDTF date handling**:
Preserve EDTF date formats in timeline entries. When consolidating timeline memories, maintain chronological order based on EDTF dates.

Overall book memory life-cycle:
raw book updates -> clean book entries -> book entries sorted by book/field -> consolidated book profiles

The more book memories you receive for a single book, the more interference there is in the book system.
This causes cognitive load and makes reading tracking difficult. Cognitive load is bad.
To minimize this, under such circumstances, you need to be more aggressive about deletion:
    - Be looser about what you consider to be similar timeline entries. Some distinctions are not worth the energy to maintain.
    - Massage out the parts to keep and ruthlessly throw away the rest
    - There is no free lunch here! At least some redundant book information must be deleted!

Do not create new book feature names outside of the standard book schema: {", ".join(FEATURES)}

**CRITICAL: You MUST return valid JSON with EXACTLY these two keys: "consolidate_memories" and "keep_memories"**

The proper noop syntax (when no consolidation is needed):
{{
    "consolidate_memories": [],
    "keep_memories": []
}}

**REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:**
<think>insert your chain of thought here</think>
{{
    "consolidate_memories": [
        {{

            "metadata": {{}}
        }}
    ],
    "keep_memories": [123, 456]
}}

**IMPORTANT RULES:**
1. ALWAYS include both "consolidate_memories" and "keep_memories" keys
2. "consolidate_memories" should be an array (empty if no consolidation needed)
3. "keep_memories" should be an array of memory IDs to keep
4. Use proper JSON syntax with double quotes, not single quotes
5. Do not include any text outside the JSON object
